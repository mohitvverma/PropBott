Final Result: content='Based on the provided information, it appears that the exact data specifies "Block 92," but does not provide detailed information about the specific unit types within this block. However, the image summary offers a comprehensive layout of the residential complex, including the distribution of blocks and amenities.\n\nFrom the image summary, we know that the complex is divided into three main blocks: Block A, Block B, and Block C. Each block consists of several smaller units numbered from 01 to 32. The amenities and layout details suggest a well-planned residential area with various facilities for residents.\n\nTo address your query about the location of 1 Bed + study units in Tembusu Grand, we need to consider the typical layout and distribution of unit types in such residential complexes. Generally, 1 Bed + study units are often found in multiple blocks to provide a variety of options for potential residents.\n\nGiven the lack of specific unit type information in the exact data, we can infer that 1 Bed + study units could be distributed across all three blocks (Block A, Block B, and Block C) to ensure a balanced offering throughout the complex. This distribution would allow residents to choose units based on their preferred proximity to amenities such as the swimming pool, tennis court, children\'s playground, and other recreational areas.\n\nTo provide a more precise answer, it would be ideal to refer to the detailed floor plans or unit distribution charts typically provided by the developer or sales office. These documents would specify the exact location of 1 Bed + study units within each block.\n\nIn summary, while the exact data does not specify the location of 1 Bed + study units, it is reasonable to assume that these units are available in multiple blocks (Block A, Block B, and Block C) within the Tembusu Grand complex. For exact unit locations, consulting the detailed floor plans or contacting the sales office would be the best course of action.' response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 382, 'prompt_tokens': 508, 'total_tokens': 890, 'completion_tokens_details': {'reasoning_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_25624ae3a5', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run-6bec0462-4d20-4fc1-962e-d682a1e41a04-0'
